### File Structure

```
hello_world_project/
│
├── hello_world.py
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

---

### File: `hello_world.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
print("Hello, World!")
```

### File: `README.md`

```markdown
# Hello, World! Application

This is a simple Python application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can verify this by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. Download or clone the `hello_world.py` script to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python hello_world.py
   ```

5. You should see the following output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (latest stable version recommended)
- No external libraries or dependencies are required.

## Compatibility

This script is compatible with all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as Python is installed.

## Making the Script Executable (Unix-based Systems)

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x hello_world.py
   ```

2. Run the script directly:
   ```bash
   ./hello_world.py
   ```

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Set Up the Project Directory:**
   - Create a directory named `hello_world_project`:
     ```bash
     mkdir hello_world_project
     cd hello_world_project
     ```

2. **Create the Files:**
   - Create the `hello_world.py` file:
     ```bash
     touch hello_world.py
     ```
   - Create the `README.md` file:
     ```bash
     touch README.md
     ```
   - Create the `LICENSE` file:
     ```bash
     touch LICENSE
     ```

3. **Write the Code:**
   - Open `hello_world.py` in a text editor and paste the provided Python code.
   - Open `README.md` and paste the provided Markdown content.
   - Open `LICENSE` and paste the provided license text.

4. **Test the Application:**
   - Run the script using the command:
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```
   - Verify the output is:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

5. **Make the Script Executable (Optional for Unix-based Systems):**
   - Make the script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x hello_world.py
     ```
   - Run the script directly:
     ```bash
     ./hello_world.py
     ```

6. **Share the Code:**
   - Save the files and share them with the requester or upload them to a version control system like GitHub.

---

### Notes:
- The code is minimal and adheres to PEP 8 guidelines.
- No error handling is required for this simple script.
- The script is cross-platform compatible.
- The shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) allows the script to be executed directly on Unix-based systems.
- The encoding declaration (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`) ensures compatibility with different systems and text editors.

---

### Example of Running the Application:

1. **On Windows:**
   - Open Command Prompt.
   - Navigate to the `hello_world_project` directory.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

2. **On macOS/Linux:**
   - Open Terminal.
   - Navigate to the `hello_world_project` directory.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python3 hello_world.py
     ```
   - Alternatively, make the script executable and run it directly:
     ```bash
     chmod +x hello_world.py
     ./hello_world.py
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```
