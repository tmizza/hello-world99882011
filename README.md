### **Project Plan: "Hello, World!" Application in Python**

#### **Objective:**
Develop a simple Python application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

---

### **Main Tasks:**

1. **Task 1: Set Up Development Environment**
   - Ensure Python is installed on the system.
   - Verify Python installation by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in the terminal.
   - Choose a text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or any plain text editor).

2. **Task 2: Write the Code**
   - Create a new Python file (e.g., `hello_world.py`).
   - Write the following code in the file:
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

3. **Task 3: Test the Application**
   - Run the Python script using the command:
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```
   - Verify that the output is:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

4. **Task 4: Document the Solution**
   - Add a brief comment at the top of the file to describe the purpose of the script:
     ```python
     # This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

5. **Task 5: Share the Code**
   - Save the file and share it with the requester or upload it to a version control system (e.g., GitHub) if needed.

---

### **Technical Considerations:**
1. **Python Version:**
   - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.x (the latest stable version is recommended).
   
2. **Code Simplicity:**
   - The solution should be minimal and use only built-in Python functionality (no external libraries or dependencies).

3. **Error Handling:**
   - No error handling is required for this simple script, as it involves only a single `print()` statement.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - The script should work on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as Python is installed.

5. **Code Formatting:**
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code formatting (e.g., use consistent indentation and avoid unnecessary spaces).

---

### **Deliverables:**
1. A Python script (`hello_world.py`) that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. A brief README file (optional) explaining how to run the script.

---

### **Timeline:**
- **Task 1:** 5 minutes
- **Task 2:** 5 minutes
- **Task 3:** 5 minutes
- **Task 4:** 5 minutes
- **Task 5:** 5 minutes

**Total Estimated Time:** 25 minutes
